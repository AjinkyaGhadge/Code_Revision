# Code_Revision
## Many times, like me we want to practice our Data-Structure and Algorithm basics. To make sure we don't forget our basics, the best thing is to practice and feel the joy of solving problems again. There are lot of resources on the web, so i'll only add some programs and explanations that were useful for me. I hope to use this as a revision, and maybe it will help anyother person in a similar situation!
